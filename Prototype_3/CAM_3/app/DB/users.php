      "ReContent": "Finishing processes can take up-to 25% of the manufacturing cost. These operations (e.g. cleaning, sanding, polishing) are highly non-repetitive. The task profile changes with change in surface geometry, material, and tool. We are creating a smart robotic assistant that can carry out the labor intensive tasks. Our technology of automated robotic finishing will significantly expand the role of robots in small and medium size productions."

      "ReContent": "Extracting a part from a bin of mixed parts is a highly non-repetitive task. Non-contact based perception system has to be used to estimate the pose of the part that is to be extracted from the bin. Any uncertainty in the part pose estimate can increase failure rates. We define several grasp strategies for a part and run a Monte Carlo simulator to estimate the execution time and the probability of success for each grasp strategy. The motion plan corresponding to the grasp strategy with lowest completion time is chosen. The robot is smart enough to perform fine positioning moves to improve pose accuracy during drop-off and invoke human intervention if a failure occurs during pose estimation or part extraction. "

      "ReContent": "The process uses solid ice to surround the built parts in the layer-by-layer fabrication process. A cooling device is used to freeze the water into ice for each layer. The photocurable resin is spread on ice surface and then solidified by a projection image. Accordingly, a complex 3D object can be fabricated without using traditional support structures. After the fabrication process, the additional ice structure can easily be removed leaving no undesired marks on the bottom surfaces."

We propose a 2 robot and a human work cell architecture to perform complicated assembly tasks in the presence of perception uncertainty. We use sensor integrated technology is used to estimate the pose of the part after it has been grasped and establish a collaboration between the robots to complete the assembly task. The role of the human is to assist the robot in complicated assembly task and handle any failures during the task execution."

In Additive Manufacturing (3D printing), the extruder is limited to travel in the XY plane to generate each layer. Due to non-continuity, the strength of the final part along the z direction can be very limited. One alternative to this problem is to print the model with tool travel in all three directions simultaneously. This requires 6 DOF. With a 6 DOF system, the extruder can be tilted on each axis to avoid hitting the layers of the part that have already been printed, as it prints each successive 3D layer."

      "ReContent": "Robotic arms designed nowadays are capable to handle complex tasks/assemblies without any human intervention. But such tasks require a robotic hand to operate with a variety of tools. This generates the need of an automatic tool changing mechanism. Commercially available tool changers are very costly as they use hydraulics or pneumatic systems for actuation. The aim of my project is to make a cheaper tool change mechanism by eliminating costly actuation systems and high tolerance requirements by 3D printing custom parts. "
